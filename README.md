# AI Hub Station - Deployment Package

This package contains all the necessary files for the AI Hub Station community website. Due to some configuration issues with TailwindCSS during local testing, I've prepared this package for deployment via GitHub and Vercel.

## Project Structure

The project is a React application with TypeScript that includes:

- Frontend components for all required pages (Home, Authentication, Dashboard, Community, Partners, Experts, Feedback, Blog)
- Backend integration with Supabase for authentication, database, and storage
- Responsive design with mobile compatibility

## Deployment

Please follow the instructions in `github_deployment_instructions.md` for deploying this application using GitHub and Vercel. The instructions include:

1. Creating a GitHub repository
2. Pushing the code to GitHub
3. Deploying with Vercel
4. Setting up automatic deployments
5. Configuring a custom domain (optional)

## Configuration

The application is configured to use your Supabase project with the following credentials:

- Supabase URL: https://wxzobzamheiqkeoqkacn.supabase.co
- Supabase Anon Key: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Ind4em9iemFtaGVpcWtlb3FrYWNuIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDM5Nzg3MzcsImV4cCI6MjA1OTU1NDczN30.QwA6JyXazZjwNU2jbtq0_HyDfMmNw-I_usAUeOlQJXA

These credentials are included in the deployment instructions as environment variables.

## Database Schema

The database schema is defined in `database_schema.sql` and includes tables for:

- Users
- Courses
- User Courses (junction table)
- Feedback
- Experts
- Partners
- Blog Posts
- Partner Requests
- Mentorship Requests
- Expert Applications

## Future Improvements

After deployment, you may want to consider the following improvements:

1. Resolve the TailwindCSS configuration issues for better styling
2. Add more interactive features to the dashboard
3. Implement real-time notifications using Supabase's realtime features
4. Add more comprehensive analytics
5. Enhance the mobile experience with additional optimizations
